"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened.","Sources of light use what 's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect", correct
"Why isn't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm ? Because aren't rain and snow basically the same thing , except one is colder ?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air . In conditions suitable for snow , it 's less common to have a situation where you 'll have upward moving warm moist air ( it 's usually not warm ! ) , so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate , like moving over a large and warm lake , to generate the needed air movement .", correct
"how are gases ( like helium ) collected and put into containers ?","The process is called fractional distillation . Because everything in air has different boiling points ( i.e. helium 's boiling point is -270 degrees C ) you can cool the gases and as each temperature is reached , the gas will liquefy and can be removed , until helium is reached and is liquefied . I hope it helps", correct
