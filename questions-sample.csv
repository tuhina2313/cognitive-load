"How was airplane technology able to advance so quickly after the Wright Brothers' first flight ? Mainly interested in how aviation was able to be deployed on a large scale during WWI.","This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a load of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer, the explosion exploded .","The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine . Every other engine development is just making what we had the year before , a bit better , a bit lighter , a bit more powerful , a bit more reliable.", correct
"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened.","Sources of light use what's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined, think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect.","The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object . So if you shine green with red , you see yellow in light . But paints differ in the color they absorb . So mixing red ( which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red ) and green ( which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow ) together gives you something that absorbs red , blue , and yellow . If they were perfectly opposed , you'd make black . Instead , you usually end up with brown because the two paints aren't diametrically opposed.", correct
"Why is n't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm ? Because are n't rain and snow basically the same thing , except one is colder ?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air . In conditions suitable for snow , it 's less common to have a situation where you 'll have upward moving warm moist air ( it 's usually not warm ! ) , so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate , like moving over a large and warm lake , to generate the needed air movement.","We occasionally get thundersnow . But my guess is that cold weather fronts do n't have the same kind of turbulent air currents that create static charges that hot air currents do.", correct
