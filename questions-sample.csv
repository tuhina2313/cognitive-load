"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened.","Sources of light use what's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined, think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect.","The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object . So if you shine green with red , you see yellow in light . But paints differ in the color they absorb . So mixing red ( which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red ) and green ( which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow ) together gives you something that absorbs red , blue , and yellow . If they were perfectly opposed , you'd make black . Instead , you usually end up with brown because the two paints aren't diametrically opposed.", correct
"Why is n't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm ? Because are n't rain and snow basically the same thing , except one is colder ?","A thunderstorm is formed in part by the strong upward motion of warm moist air . In conditions suitable for snow , it 's less common to have a situation where you 'll have upward moving warm moist air ( it 's usually not warm ! ) , so it tends to take certain infrequent circumstances to generate , like moving over a large and warm lake , to generate the needed air movement.","We occasionally get thundersnow . But my guess is that cold weather fronts do n't have the same kind of turbulent air currents that create static charges that hot air currents do.", correct
"How are movies edited to be in 3D when they are't originally filmed in 3D ? Like Lord of the Rings","They have a bunch of people cut out the foreground from the background ( rotoscoping ) and place it in depth using software . They move stuff around and paint out the seams . Then they re - render the movie from two virtual cameras . Turns out a lot people aren't very discerning when it comes to 3d , and it 's cheaper and less hassle than using two cameras during the shoot .","For films that use a lot of green \/ blue screen ( LOTR , Avatar , Avengers ) , the CG background can be made as a 3D object . That way , the only thing that they have to make 3D in post are the actors , and they're separated already . Also , many older films that used the red and blue glasses were three frames : One that was red , one was blue , and one that was full color . One of the red \/ blue frames was offset in order to create depth to the image .", correct
