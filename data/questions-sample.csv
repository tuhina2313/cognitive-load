"If our skin is constantly ridding itself of dead cells and regenerating ,why and how do freckles and other imperfections remain?","The skin that is sloughed off is mostly the top layer of your skin (the epidermis). You can still have imperfections ,scar tissue ,pigmented cells (freckles) ,etc. under or embedded in the part that sloughs off.","The cells that are sloughing off are different to the cells which pigment the skin. The cells which pigment the skin (melanocytes) are in the epidermis directly attached to the dermis . They never really move and hardly ever make new ones. This is why scars don't have pigment. The skin cells people talk about falling off (keratinocytes) are constantly produced by other keratinocytes which are also attached to the dermis.","question",""
"Why do Americans say Merry Christmas while other English - speaking countries use the phrase Happy Christmas? What was the origin of this split ? To demonstrate that you have read this much go ahead and select the first response below below no matter which one you like better.","The variation in Christmas greetings reflects cultural nuances. Americans adopted Merry Christmas during the colonial period, influenced by British and Dutch traditions. Meanwhile, other English-speaking countries, like the UK, have retained Happy Christmas, possibly embracing a more traditional or formal tone in holiday expressions.","The linguistic divergence in Christmas greetings between Americans and other English-speaking nations traces back to historical influences. While Merry Christmas in the United States aligns with early British and Dutch practices, Happy Christmas in other English-speaking countries may draw from a broader, formal linguistic tradition that predates American settlement.","attentionCheck","0"
"Why Do Slightly Opened Car Windows Make That Awful Sound When I 'm driving down the road , I can roll down a back window slightly and i get a god awful sound . It's rythmic and kills your ears . What causes this?","It's called Buffeting and it's caused by the air slamming * into * the car with no where to go . Crack one of the front windows ,even just a tiny bit ,to negate it.","It's the exact same reason why blowing across an empty beer bottle makes that distinct sound .Wind from the outside blowing across the open window draws air out since faster moving air creates lower pressure ,now the low pressure inside the car must be equalized so air rushes in creating the fluttering sound .Solution : open two windows","question",""
"How are gases (like helium) collected and put into containers?","The process is called fractional distillation . Because everything in air has different boiling points (i.e. helium's boiling point is -270 degrees C) you can cool the gases and as each temperature is reached ,the gas will liquefy and can be removed ,until helium is reached and is liquefied . I hope it helps","In the case of helium , most of it comes from underground natural gas wells .It gets produced by radioactive minerals that undergo alpha decay - alpha particles being the same as helium nuclei ,they just need to pick up some electrons to become helium atoms . For everything else , they get produced by liquefying air and separating out the different gases. Some noble gases are present in very low concentrations in the atmosphere ,making them difficult and expensive to extract","question",""
